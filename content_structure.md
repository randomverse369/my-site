## 3️⃣ How I Work  *(Critical Section)*

### **How I Work**

My approach to designing products in remote, cross-functional teams.

---

### 🔍 Problem Framing

I start by understanding the problem through **conversations, audits, data, and secondary research**.
Before jumping into solutions, I focus on clarifying goals, constraints, and assumptions to ensure design efforts are grounded in real needs and context.

---

### 🤝 Collaboration

I work closely with product managers, developers, BAs, SMEs, and stakeholders to align on priorities and decisions.
I communicate design rationale clearly and early to reduce rework and keep teams aligned.

**Tools I commonly use:**
Jira, Figma, Google Workspace

---

### ⚙️ Execution & Delivery

I balance speed and quality based on product priorities and timelines.
I design with development feasibility in mind, maintain consistency through systems, and adapt quickly when requirements change — without losing clarity or intent.

## 5️⃣ About (Subtle & Mature)

### **About**

I’m a product designer with 6+ years of experience designing web and mobile products across different stages — from early builds to large-scale platforms. Over the years, I’ve grown from visual design into end-to-end product design by working closely with founders, product teams, and engineers.

I care about clarity, usability, and outcomes. Recently, I’ve been actively exploring how AI can enhance product workflows — using it practically for prototyping, exploration, and improving efficiency in everyday design work.

Outside work, I enjoy sci-fi, anime, music, and learning at my own pace.

# Shoonya Case Study
Stabilizing a Web Trading Platform Redesign Under Real-World Constraints

1. Project Snapshot (Top Summary Card)
Product
Shoonya — Web & Mobile Trading Platform
Industry
Fintech / Trading
Duration
6 months
Team
Product Managers, Business Analysts, SMEs, Developers, External Design Agency
My Role
Product Designer (UX / UI)

2. Context & Background
Shoonya is a trading platform designed for active retail traders, available across web and mobile. When I joined the organization, a redesign initiative was already in motion.
The mobile app redesign had progressed significantly, and leadership decided to revamp the web trading platform in parallel. Due to internal trust and alignment challenges, an external design agency was hired to support research and design.
I joined the project mid-way, inheriting:
Partially designed features
An incomplete design system
Fragmented design ownership across teams
Active sprint timelines with ongoing development
This created a complex environment where delivery needed to continue despite unclear ownership and evolving inputs.

3. The Core Problem
The primary challenge wasn’t just redesigning a trading platform — it was stabilizing design execution under constraints.
Key Challenges
Split design ownership between internal teams and an external agency
Incomplete and inconsistently applied design system
Limited set of features designed, while development required more
Frequent requirement changes from BAs and SMEs
High dependency on design for development continuity
Without intervention, this setup risked:
UI inconsistency
Increased rework
Design–development friction
Delivery delays

4. User Interviews (Initiative Under Constraints)
Even though the redesign was already underway, I believed grounding decisions in real user needs was critical — especially for a high-stakes trading product.
I independently conducted interviews with ~10 active Shoonya users to understand:
Daily trading workflows
High-frequency actions and pain points
Friction areas in the existing platform
Expectations from a modern trading experience
Key Outcomes
From these conversations, I synthesized recurring patterns and created user personas to help align both internal teams and the external design agency around user context.
These insights were shared with stakeholders and the agency to reduce assumption-driven decisions and provide user grounding.
[❓ Add: What were 2–3 major pain points users repeatedly mentioned?]

5. Personas (Condensed & Purposeful)
Instead of creating multiple detailed personas, I distilled insights into 1–2 focused personas representing core trader behaviors.
These personas emphasized:
Goals (speed, clarity, confidence)
Constraints (time pressure, cognitive load)
Usage patterns (frequent monitoring, fast actions)
Personas were used as a reference point during design reviews and requirement discussions.
[❓ Insert persona image or summary here]

6. Competitive Context (Lightweight Benchmarking)
To understand industry expectations and avoid usability gaps, I reviewed established trading platforms.
The goal was not imitation, but to:
Identify common interaction patterns
Validate information hierarchy decisions
Understand standard trading flows
This helped reinforce decisions around:
Placement of Watchlist, Positions, and Orders
Reducing friction in high-frequency actions
Maintaining familiarity for experienced traders
[❓ Which competitors did you review? Add 2–3 names if allowed]

7. My Role & Responsibilities
Within this constrained setup, I acted as the execution and stabilization layer of the redesign.
Responsibilities
Auditing and restructuring agency-provided Figma files
Rebuilding and aligning screens with the design system
Maintaining consistency across newly designed features
Organizing files, components, and iterations for developer use
Acting as the design point-of-contact during sprints
Questioning and clarifying requirements with BAs and SMEs

8. What I Did (Execution Under Pressure)
Design System Alignment
Identified inconsistencies in components, spacing, and styles
Extended and refined the existing design system where needed
Ensured new screens adhered to shared components
Screen & Flow Execution
Recreated key features such as:
Watchlist
Trade flow
Positions
[❓ Add other key features you worked on]
Sprint Collaboration
Participated in scrum meetings
Prioritized screens based on development needs
Shared iterative updates with developers to avoid blockers

9. Design Decisions Under Constraints
Given limited control over strategy and research direction, I focused on high-impact decisions:
Prioritizing consistency over visual novelty
Reducing cognitive load in data-dense screens
Ensuring feasibility within existing front-end constraints
Balancing speed with system integrity
These decisions helped maintain product quality while keeping delivery moving.

10. Collaboration & Communication
I collaborated closely with:
Developers — for feasibility, handoff, and iteration
Business Analysts & SMEs — for functional clarity
Product Managers — for prioritization and alignment
I made it a point to:
Ask clarifying questions early
Push back on unclear or risky changes
Adapt designs pragmatically when constraints required it

11. Outcome & Impact
While this project is ongoing / partially shipped, my contributions helped:
Remove design bottlenecks during development
Improve UI consistency across redesigned features
Reduce design–development friction
Establish a stronger foundation for scaling the design system
[❓ If available: any qualitative feedback from devs, PMs, or managers?]

12. Reflection & Learnings
This project reinforced several important lessons:
Strong systems matter more than perfect screens
Design ownership clarity is critical, but adaptability is essential
Real-world constraints require judgment, not rigid process
Working on Shoonya strengthened my ability to operate effectively in complex, fast-moving environments — especially when ideal UX conditions aren’t available.

13. What I’d Do Differently (Optional but Strong)
If I had full ownership from the start, I would:
Establish design ownership and workflows earlier
Align stakeholders on research insights sooner
Invest more time in validating high-risk flows before execution
